Ω-Net (Omega Net)
</h1>
</center>

## Introduction
This is an implementation of `Ω-Net` node in Rust based on the `Substrate` framework. It's an Ethereum Compatible `Parachain` converted from a Solo chain (checkout to this commit `2988544c883b486842c4cac88b9a8c30c2c3a1de` if you'd want to use the Solo Chain instead of `Parachain`)

- `Omega Net` is `EVM-compatible`, enabling its users to leverage infrastructure from the `Ethereum` ecosystem.
- It uses the same address format as `Ethereum` and the `ECDSA` cryptographic algorithm, which is also used by `Ethereum`. This means that addresses in `Omega Net` will be fully compatible with Ethereum addresses.
- The native token `OMC` will have the same precision as `ETH` on the `Ethereum` blockchain.
- Developers can use the familiar `Ethereum` infrastructure to develop applications on `Omega Net`.

`Omega Net` provides a stronger foundation for future development, resulting in higher code quality, faster iteration cycles, shorter cross-chain routing paths, and an improved user experience.
